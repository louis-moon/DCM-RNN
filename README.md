# Dynamic Causal Modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks (DCM-RNN) for Effective Brain Connectivity Analysis
## Introduction
The DCM-RNN project is a pioneering initiative at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning, developed as a part of a senior thesis at Yale University for a B.S. in Statistics & Data Science. This repository contains code and methodologies to integrate Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), aiming to advance our understanding of effective brain connectivity. The project leverages functional neuroimaging data, offering an innovative approach to decode the complex neural interactions within the human brain.

## Features
- DCM-RNN Integration: Combines the principles of Dynamic Causal Modeling with the advanced capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks.
- Neuroimaging Data Analysis: Utilizes functional neuroimaging data to explore and understand brain connectivity.
- Simulation Framework: Includes a comprehensive simulation environment to model and analyze neural spike data.
- BOLD Signal Computation: Features an algorithm to convert spike times into BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) signals, crucial for fMRI data analysis.
- Customizable Neural Models: Allows for the modification and testing of different neural network architectures to suit various research needs.
- Interdisciplinary Approach: Encapsulates an intersection of neuroscience, data science, and computational modeling, reflecting a multi-faceted approach to research.
